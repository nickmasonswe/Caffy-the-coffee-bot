# Coffee-bot
Caffy the Python chat-bot serves customers at his local bean-house. Caffy exists to help cut the wait time of grabbing coffee.
Very simple exercise using Python 3. This is the simplest of the chat-bots that I have created (or will create, depending on how early you are reading this) using Python in order to sharpen my skills with the syntax.

This chat-bot is simply a dialogue tree.
